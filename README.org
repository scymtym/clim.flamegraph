* Introduction

  The ~clim.flamegraph~ system is a proof of concept application for
  [[https://common-lisp.net/project/mcclim/][McCLIM]] that displays profiling data recorded uses [[http://sbcl.org][SBCL]]'s ~sb-sprof~
  contrib module as a flamegraph, i.e. a visualization of the relative
  frequencies of function call chains.

  *This system uses an interface that has been introduced in SBCL
  1.4.6, so at least that SBCL version is required*.

  *SBCL 1.4.13 includes an important performance improvement for
  sorting profiling results. If redisplay performance is not good
  enough, try using that SBCL version.*
